## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the stability of boundary layer flows and understanding how disturbances grow and eventually lead to transition to turbulence. The work includes generating base-flow profiles, performing modal stability analysis, and computing transient energy growth for different shear flows.

## Key Features
- Linear stability analysis using Orr–Sommerfeld and Squire operators  
- Spectral collocation with Chebyshev polynomials  
- Computation of eigenvalues, growth rates, and phase speeds  
- Non-modal (transient growth) analysis for identifying optimal disturbances  
- Base flows studied: Poiseuille, Blasius, and uniform-shear boundary layers  
- Visualization of spectra, disturbance structures, and amplification trends  

## Tools Used
- **Mathematica**  
  - Symbolic computations  
  - Spectral differentiation  
  - Matrix construction for OS–Squire systems  
  - Eigenvalue solvers  
  - Transient growth simulations  
  - Plot generation  

## Applications
- Studying hydrodynamic stability  
- Predicting transition in boundary layers  
- Research in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics  
- Educational demonstrations in stability theory
